- Change the following settings as shown in the picture
	- When you **create a new daily note, it will automatically move it to the corresponding folder** based on the year
	- You can change "YYYY" to the date format of your choice 
	- You can also add monthly folders under the year folders
		- YYYY/MM/YYYY-MM-DD
	- Refer to the format preference to customize what's best for your vaut
